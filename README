linux-gpib provides kernel drivers for GPIB devices, as well as userspace
libraries and bindings for Guile, Perl, PHP, Python, and TCL. The C library API 
is intended to be compatible with National Instruments' GPIB library.

Note that the PHP bindings are currently broken and are disabled in this
SlackBuild.

This SlackBuild includes support for ISA devices, which are disabled by default.

Default linux-gpib udev rules expect the group gpib to exist. Create it before
using the linux-gpib drivers:

groupadd gpib
