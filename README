This plugin adds support to Python Pygments for syntax highlighting router
configuration files. It is intended to build from a GitHub ZIP archive, since
no other form of distribution exists for this project. By default, it assumes
you will be building against the `master` branch with an archive called
`master.zip`

If you're building against a branch other than master, you can set the BRANCH
environment variable:

BRANCH="your_topic_branch" ./Pygments-RouterLexers.SlackBuild

Note that the MD5 sum is correct for the 0.3.2 release of this plugin; however,
the author does not currently tag releases so you may end up with a snapshot
of `master` that has a different MD5!
